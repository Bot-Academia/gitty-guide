# Introduction

Gitty is a discord bot made using discord.js a powerful javascript library build upon Node.JS. Gitty is made to help open source communities that are using Discord. As we all know that communication plays a major role in open source world and as these organizations are becoming larger everyday there should be a efficient method to resolve this issue. Gitty provides you enriching features to reduce communication gap in a community and streamline workflow.

## What's under the hood?

While building Gitty the main aim in our head was to bring github related info over to discord. For making this possible we used the Github api

```
https://api.github.com/orgs/Bot-Academia
```

The github API is extremly feature rich and provided us with everything we needed to make this bot possible.

## Why you need gitty?

Gitty is a github oriented bot, it has all the features that any org or personal user will require during their development process. We ourselves used it for the development of gitty website and documentation. The webhook Feature made it extremly easy for us to get notified with all the changes happening inside the repo.
